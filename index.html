       <h2 class="about-me">About Me</h2> 
       <p class="tab">I was introduced to the world of tech in 2018. I became a recruiter because I enjoy working with people and brining positive change to their lives. Through working with Denver's top tech talent, I became fascinated with software and web development. It was exciting to have convesations with people about their work, and with each conversation, I learned a little more. I knew that I had to take the next step (or plunge, really) to learn more.</p>
       <p class="tab">As a student at <a href="https://www.thinkful.com/" target="_blank">Thinkful</a>, I have the opportunity to challenge myself while soaking up knowledge of many new concepts and skills. I hope to one day build websites and applications that increase efficiency in the talent acquisition, mental health, social welfare, and/or political spaces. I look forward to collaborating with other creative, intuitive, and diverse individuals and seeing the solutions we can build together!</p>
